# Transparent Corporate Network Proxy
In corporates, developers often face the problem of a proxy.

You enter the corporate network.
Git: Broke.
Docker: Broke.
Sometimes, even the webbrowser: Broke.

Okay, nevermind. I'll just set up the proxy in all those applications.

Then you leave the corporate network.
Git: Broke.
Docker: Broke.
Sometimes, even the webbrowser: Broke.

This is because the corporate proxy is not accessible from outside the corporate network.

Means you have to remove all proxy settings again.
